# TwoCars-Simple-CLI  
A Simple Two Cars Game Remake with C++ for command line usage  
  
  
## How to play  
Similar to TwoCars on smartphones, avoid the 'X's and take 'O's.  
Keys: 'A', 'D', Space, ESC, Left Arrow, Right Arrow, Up Arrow, Down Arrow.  
##### Functions:  
- **'A' Or Left Arrow**
*To Make Left Car Swap Lane.*
- **'D' Or Right Arrow**
*To Make Right Car Swap Lane.*
- **Space Or Up Arrow Or Down Arrow**
*To Make Both Cars Swap Lane.*
- **ESC**
*End The Game.*
  
## How to build  
You might need Microsoft Visual Studio to make a successful build or another C++ compiler that supports windows header files and its corresponding functions such as _kbhit and _getch.  
Good Luck on your build.  
If you encounter any problem or face any issues you could just ask or make a request.  

## Notes  
This project is build to work on windows machines so to make a successful build you need windows header files and to run it properly you need a windows machine.  
I might make it cross platform later but for now it should do it.  
  
### Two Cars CLI was created just for educational purposes. And it has been amended by Social Group Admin. If you need anything you can ask me or if you want to make this project bigger, feel free to do a PR.
